    <h1>Epigenetics Article</h1>
    <div class="text">Epigenetics studies how environments and behaviors such as physical activeness, 
        dietary, and substance usage cause changes that alter the way genes function without changing 
        the DNA sequence. Genes are a unit of heredity passed from parent to offspring made of
         sequences of DNA. Genes play a crucial role in health but so do environments and behaviors. 
         From the video, it is clear that lifestyles and diets change the expression of genes. 
         Twins, especially identical twins, have the same DNA and genes as they come from the same egg.
          As twins grow and develop, they start to diverge in their appearance and health.
           According to the study, as we age based on twins, our epigenetic differences accumulate 
           depending on our lifestyles. This is why we have cases of hereditary diseases being prone 
           to family members who live similar lifestyles to those who had them and skipping other
            family members. It also explains the cases of one twin having a genetic disease or 
            disorder and the other being healthy such as the case of Annamarie and Clotilde from 
            the video. Like in this case study of the twins, so do close family members have similar 
            genes, that is, parents and siblings. However, as we grow old and relocate, we alter our 
            gene functionality depending on our lifestyles and environments... </div>
